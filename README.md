# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. The game board is represented as a list of integers from 1 to 9, and the game is played between two players who take turns entering numbers to mark spots on the board.

## Features

- Draws the game board.
- Performs a move.
- Checks for a winner.
- Starts the game.

## Usage

To play the game, run the Python script. The game will then prompt you to enter the number corresponding to the spot you want to mark on the board. If the move is valid, the game board will be updated and it will switch to the other player. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.

## Installation

No installation is required as this is a Python script. Just ensure you have Python installed on your system.
